# Tensai Bakabon (Sega Master System): English Translation

## About
This is the source code for the complete English translation of Tensai Bakabon for the Sega Master System.

## Folders
* `asm`
	* Contains the asm files which are to be compiled with armips.
* `roms`
	* Use this to store your roms
* `script`
	* Contains the dump script in `Script.json`. It contains the Japanese script and the English translation.
	* You can also store xlsx backups of the script here.
* `tables`
	* "Dictionary" specifies dictionary mapping. A dictionary can be mapped to multiple character values for compression purposes.
	* "FindAndReplace" does some text replacement before serializing to JSON / inserting to the rom.
	* Files with "Length" let you specify how wide, in pixels, characters are. This affects spiro.exe's auto-linebreaking logic.
* `graphics` / `tilemap`
	* Where compressed data is managed
	* Subfolder `compressed (new)` is where compressed version of custom assets are stored.
	* Subfolder `uncompressed (new)` is where uncompressed custom (mostly translated) assets are stored.
	* Subfolder `uncompressed (original)` is where the original uncompressed assets dumped from the rom are stored.
* `tools`
	* `armips` a fork of armips that supports z80 assembly language patches.
	* `compression` [the RLE (de)compressor.](https://github.com/romh-acking/tensei-bakabon-de-compressor)

It contains two versions of the manual: one with all the Japanese text blanked out and one that is typesetted. Much thanks to Sega Retro for the scans of the manual.
